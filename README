This project contains the source code with the flowers section of the 
Beehive Simulator project from the book C# Head First. 
The behavior of the flowers has been extended and here they are born,
grow and are removed, giving space to new ones. The speed of growth 
can be modified as well as the number of the flowers in the field.
Hope you can enjoy the code as much as I did developing this extended
version of the popular simulator. Thanks for all!.
